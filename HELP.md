# Spring core patterns(springcore package)

    - Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection in Spring
    - Constructor, Setter and Field injection
    - Use of @Qualifier and @Primary
    - Lazy initializations, either with @Lazy or inside the Properties files
    - Bean Scopes   
    - Bean lifecycle Method(@PostConstruct and @PreDestroy)
    - use of @Bean with @Configuration : Sometimes you can't annotate a Class as @Componenent
        - In case when you import 3rd party classes
